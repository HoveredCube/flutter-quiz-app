## Why did I made this App?
As I'm currently learning Flutter I developed this Training Project to practice my flutter skills and learn something new! so yeah, expect to see some problems and mistakes in the source code!

### Some features of the 90Quiz challenge app
 - This app provides you a single quiz everyday for 90 days
 - Provides you more information about each quiz
 - It tracks your status such as number of correct answers, best streak and ...
 - The Streak design in the homepage changes as your streak goes up (up to 10 streak which is the gold card)
